## Installation
Install boo with your favorite package manager.

#### lazy.nvim
```lua
{
	'LukasPietzschmann/boo.nvim',
	opts = {
		-- here goes your config :)
	},
}
```

#### Others
With other package managers, you probably need to call the setup function yourself:
```lua
require('boo').setup({
	-- here goes your config :)
})
```

## Usage
1. You have to load boo
```lua
local boo = require('boo')
```
2. Then, you can call the `boo` function, which will show the pop-up
```lua
boo.boo()
```
3. You can also manually close the pop-up with
```lua
boo.close()
```

## Configuration
Here comes the default configuration with some explanation:
```lua
{
	-- win_opts will be used when creating the window. You can put everything here,
	-- that vim.api.nvim_open_win (https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html#nvim_open_win())
	-- can handle.
	win_opts = {
		title = 'LSP Info',
		title_pos = 'center',
		relative = 'cursor',
		row = 1,
		col = 0,
		style = 'minimal',
		border = 'rounded',
		focusable = true,
	},
	-- The window will not be wider than max_width (in character cells)
	max_width = 80,
	-- The window will not be taller than max_height (in character cells)
	max_height = 20,
	-- When the boo window is focused, pressing one of these will close it.
	-- They will only be mapped in normalmode
	escape_mappings = { 'q', '<esc>' },
	-- Focus boo's window automatically after it's created
	focus_on_open = true,
	-- When the boo window is focused, and you'll focus another buffer,
	-- the window will be closed when this is set to true
	close_on_leave = true,
	-- When moving the cursor in the buffer that boo was opened from, boo
	-- will be closed. This makes most sense when paired with
	-- `focus_on_open = false`
	close_on_mouse_move = true,
	-- Opens boo whenever the `CursorHold` autocommand triggers. Notice that
	-- if you have set the `updatetime` to a low value, turning this on might
	-- be annoying.
	open_on_cursor_hold = false,
	-- Determines if any info messages are shown when boo is opened by the
	-- `CursorHold` autocommand. Currently, the only info message is the one
	-- telling the user that there is nothing to display for the element
	-- underneath the cursor.
	silent_cursor_hold = true,
}
```
